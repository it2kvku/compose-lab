# Compose Lab

## Overview

**Compose Lab** is a collection of projects and code samples aimed at exploring **Jetpack Compose**, **Modern Android UI Development**, **Navigation**, and various **Architecture** patterns for Android apps. This repository serves as a practical guide for learning and implementing Android's latest UI toolkit â€” **Jetpack Compose**.

Each project demonstrates key concepts such as **adaptive UIs**, **state management**, **navigation**, **data handling**, and **best practices** with Compose and Kotlin.

## Projects

### 1. **it2kvku**
- A project with custom components and advanced UI design using **Jetpack Compose**.
- Focused on exploring UI components like **Cards**, **Lists**, and **Animations**.

### 2. **AdaptiveUi**
- **Objective**: Build responsive and adaptive layouts for various screen sizes and configurations (tablet, foldable, etc.).
- Uses **Compose Layouts** and **Modifier** to ensure adaptive UI.
- Implemented **Responsive Design** using **ConstraintLayout** in Jetpack Compose.

### 3. **JetNews**
- A fully functional **news reader app** built with **Jetpack Compose**.
- Demonstrates concepts such as **LazyColumn**, **State management**, and **UI theming**.
- Implements **Navigation** and **ViewModel** for managing UI state and data.

### 4. **MigrationCodelab**
- A code lab to help migrate existing **XML-based UI** to **Jetpack Compose**.
- The project demonstrates how to refactor UI components, handle state, and integrate Compose into legacy apps.

### 5. **Navigation**
- A sample app demonstrating **Navigation in Jetpack Compose**.
- Uses **Navigation Compose** to handle screen transitions and back stack management.
- Implements **Deep linking** and **Navigation arguments**.

### 6. **Reply**
- A **messaging app** built using **Jetpack Compose**.
- Implements **Navigation**, **state management**, and **UI responsiveness**.
- Demonstrates **Composable functions**, **Custom UI elements**, and **Theming**.

### 7. **Basics**
- A simple, yet comprehensive lab introducing the basics of **Jetpack Compose**.
- Covers fundamental concepts like **Layouts**, **Modifiers**, and **State** management in Compose.

## Key Technologies & Tools

- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern UI toolkit for building Android UIs with **Kotlin**.
- **Kotlin**: A statically-typed programming language that runs on the **JVM** and is the official language for Android development.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for Android development, supporting **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin**.
- **Navigation Compose**: A library for managing app navigation in Jetpack Compose.
- **ViewModel**: A key component for managing UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.
- **LiveData**: Used for reactive data handling and UI updates in Jetpack Compose.

## Features

- **Composable Functions**: Create reusable and declarative UI components.
- **State Management**: Manage and observe UI state using **State** and **LiveData**.
- **Theming & Styling**: Apply custom themes and styles across your app using **Material Design** components and **Jetpack Compose** modifiers.
- **Modularization**: Each project is modular to allow independent learning and integration.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Follow the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture for a clean separation of concerns.
